    <b>Basic data tab</b><br />
    <br />
    Inside this tab it goes the main information about an item.<br />
    It has several fields to fill, according to the module it belongs to.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:6:"Access";s:1689:"<br />
    <b>Access tab</b><br />
    <br />
    Here the individual rights for each item are defined.<br />
    <br />
    The rights are: Read, Write, Access, Create, Copy, Delete, Download and Admin.<br />
    The users that have access to this tab for a specific item, like the owner (creator) of it, can assign these rights
    to other users for this item.<br />
    <br />
    The users that appear in the select list of this tab, that are the ones you can assign rights to, are all the users
    that have access to the parent Project, except for the logged user who is seeing the tab. If you want an unlisted
    user to be listed in the select field, you have to give him/her access to all parent projects.<br />
    The aim of that tab is to select what users you want to give access to the item and what kind of access.<br />
    For example, you create an item and choose some users to give them 'Read' access and if you want you can choose
    another user and give him/her 'Write' access.<br />
    <br />
    The different permissions are:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Read</b>: see the item.<br />
    <b>Write</b>: modify the item.<br />
    <b>Access</b>: pass through the item (e.g.: see the sub projects but not to see the project itself).<br />
    <b>Create</b>: create sub items.<br />
    <b>Copy</b>: copy the item to create other one.<br />
    <b>Delete</b>: delete the item.<br />
    <b>Download</b>: download files (for example in the Filemanager module).<br />
    <b>Admin</b>: allows to do all, including editing the access of the item.<br />
    <br />
    Note: the owner (creator) of the item has by default all the permissions.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:12:"Notification";s:385:"<br />
    <b>Notification tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This tab makes possible to send an automatic email notification to all the users with read access to the current
    item, or the users that the current module has defined according its own criteria. That email will tell them about
    the creation or modification of the item giving details about it.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:7:"History";s:231:"<br />
    <b>History tab</b><br />

    This is the <b>General Help of Calendar module</b><br />
    <br />
    The Calendar is a very complete module for managing events. You can create an event, set descriptive info to it,
    assign it date and time, specify participants, create a particular recurrence for the event, and the rest of
    general properties of the modules, like Access rights, mail Notification and History registry.<br />
    <br />
    The <b>screen</b> is divided into 5 sections:<br />

                    <u>It has two subtypes</u> that are chosen through the <b>Self</b> and <b>Selection</b> tab tabs
                    appear at the right of the same bar, when <b>Day</b> mode is active:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Self:</b> the events of the chosen day, for the current user are shown.

                            <b>Selection:</b> when this tab is pressed, a pop-up window appears letting the user
                            select a small group of people so that the list of events will have as many columns as
                            users selected; there will be seen a group schedule for the active day.
                        </li>

            </ul>
            When the Day, Week or Month view are active, it appears a schedule bar over the listings.
            It has the <i>previous</i>, <i>today</i> and <i>next</i> links to change the day / week / month in
            sequence. Also it shows the date of the selected period.<br />
            <br />
            <b>Drag and Resize</b><br />
            <br />
            In Day and Week views, the events are able to be dragged and resized to any visible place in the panel.
            If you click any event, it is opened in the form, but you can also drag and drop it in another place and
            the new time / day will be stored in the database. You can also drag the bottom border of any event to
            increase and decrease the length of the it. In all cases the descriptive content of the event gets changed
            automatically while you are dragging its shape or bottom border and the saving process occurs automatially
            when you release the mouse button.<br />
            If you drag a multiple days event, the boxes that correspond to other days of the same event get invisible,
            when the event is dropped they get visible again but in the new position.<br />
            The Day view in the Selection mode doesn't allow to modify the events of other users, just yours.<br />

    <br />";s:12:"Participants";s:5414:"<br />
    <b>Participants tab</b><br />
    <br />
    There is no Access tab in this module, instead, it is used this Participants tab that allows adding participants to
    the event. The owner (creator) of the event has full access to the related events of all participants, and all
    occurrencies, the rest of the participants are only able to modify the 'status' and 'tag' fields of Basic Data tab
    of their respective events.  They can't modify other thing nor delete the event.<br />
    This tab is only seen by the owner of the opened event.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Scope of each event and participants</b><br />
    <br />
    When it is created an event with many participants, internally as many events as participants are created although
    only the author is able to modify the events, the participants can't modify nor delete their events.<br />
    When an owner modifies an event or tries to delete it, the action may be applied to his/her event or also to all
    participants, the system will eventually ask it.<br />
    When an owner creates or modifies a multiple participants/occurrencies event, the 'status' field of all the
    participants is set to Pending, so that they can confirm (or confirm again) whether they agree to participate in
    the event.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Layout</b><br />
    <br />
    The tab has a select box and an Add button at its right side. You select a user, click the button and it will be
    added as a participant under the select box the name of the user and a cross button that permits you to take it out.
    This way you are adding participants to the event so that they will see it in their views of Calendar module, and
    will receive a Notification if the checkbox of Notification tab is checked to send it.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Pop-up Dialog: To whom will this apply (Edit)</b><br />
    <br />
    When the owner (creator) of an event that has participants in this tab modifies the content of any tab of the event,
    a pop-up dialog will appear when he/she presses Save button. That dialog asks what events will these modifications
    apply to. Available buttons to answer are:<br />
    Edit just for me => changes will affect just owner event, participants won't see them.<br />
    Edit for all participants => changes will be applied to events of all participants.<br />
    <br />
    This dialog may be combined with the recurrence one (see 'Recurrence tab' help). If both dialogs appear asking you
    how to save the event, the results may be the following, according to your answers:<br />
    <br />
    1 - First answer: Edit just this occurrence - Second answer: Edit just for me<br />
    The changes will apply to this occurrence of the whole series, and just for logged user. The rest of the dates and
    participants won't be affected.<br />
    <br />
    2 - First answer: Edit just this occurrence - Second answer: Edit for all participants<br />
    The changes will apply just to this occurrence of the whole series, but for logged user and all participants.<br />
    <br />
    3 - First answer: Edit all occurrences - Second answer: Edit just for me<br />
    The changes will apply to the whole series of events but just for logged user. The rest of participants won't be
    affected.<br />
    <br />
    4 - First answer: Edit all occurrences - Second answer: Edit for all participants<br />
    The changes will apply to the whole series of events and for logged user and all participants. This is the maximum
    possible scope for the changes.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Pop-up Dialog: To whom will this apply (Delete)</b><br />
    <br />
    When the owner (creator) of an event that has participants in this tab tries to delete it, a pop-up dialog will
    appear when he/she presses Delete button. That dialog asks what events will this deletion apply to. Available
    buttons to answer are:<br />
    Delete just for me => deletion will affect just owner event, participants will remain.<br />
    Delete for all participants => deletion will be applied to events of all participants.<br />
    <br />
    This dialog may be combined with the recurrence one (see 'Recurrence tab' help). If both dialogs appear asking you
    how to delete the event, the results may be the following, according to your answers:<br />

    <br />";s:10:"Recurrence";s:6048:"<br />
    <b>Recurrence Tab</b><br />
    <br />
    Recurrence tab allows setting a recurrence to the events so that the same event is repeated later one or more
    times, according to a user defined pattern.<br />
    The resulting series of events may be later edited individually or all at once, and they will be connected as an
    individual series of recurrent events. The owner (creator) of the event has full access to the related events of
    all participants, and all occurrencies, the rest of the participants are only able to modify the 'status' and 'tag'
    fields of Basic Data tab of their respective events.  They can't modify other thing nor delete the event.<br />
    When an owner modifies an event or tries to delete it, the action may be applied to the open event or also to all
    occurrencies, if any. A pop-up dialog (explained here later) will ask it.<br />
    <br />
    When you press Save all the parameters defined inside this tab are sent to the server and this last one calculates
    and creates the appropriate events.<br />
    <br />
    When an owner creates or modifies a multiple participants/occurrencies event, the 'status' field of all the
    participants is set to Pending, so that they can confirm (or confirm again) whether they agree to participate in
    the event.<br />
    <br />
    It has 4 fields to specify recurrence parameters. The combination of all of them will determine the final result:
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Repeats</b><br />
    Select: here you can choose the recurrence frequency. Possible options are None, Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Interval</b><br />
    Text: here you write a number for the interval to be applied to 'Repeats' field content. Default value is '1'.<br />
    E.g.: Repeats Daily, Interval 1 will make the event to happen everyday, with Interval 2 will make it happen every
    other day.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Until</b><br />
    The day the event will stop being repeated. This day will be included in the series.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Week days</b><br />
    If you choose Weekly or Monthly in Repeats field, here you can choose a day of the week when you want the event to
    happen.<br />
    E.g.: If today is 5 of October Monday and you create an event that starts and ends today and select Weekly in
    Repeats, 1 in Interval, 2009-10-25 in Until and Tuesday in Week day, the following events will be created.<br />
    1 - Tuesday 6 of October<br />
    2 - Tuesday 13 of October<br />
    3 - Tuesday 20 of October<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Pop-up Dialog: Edit repeating events</b><br />
    <br />
    When a user tries to modify an event that is part of a series and presses Save a pop-up dialog will appear.
    That dialog asks what events will these modifications apply to. Available buttons to answer are:<br />
    Edit just this occurrence => changes will affect just this event, the rest of the series will remain the same.
    <br />
    Edit all occurrences => changes will be applied to each event of the series.<br />
    <br />
    This dialog may be combined with the participants one (see 'Participants tab' help). If both dialogs appear asking

    This is the <b>General Help of Administration module</b><br />
    <br />
    This module is only accessible to users with Admin profile.<br />
    It is located at the top right global modules, the last one.<br />
    <br />
    Here, general settings of the site that affect all users or specific ones in case of User submodule, can be set and
    modified.<br />
    <br />
    It is formed by 5 tabs:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Module</b><br />
    This is the Module Designer, a very easy-to-use visual drag & drop interface to create modules or modify many
    existing ones.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Tab</b><br />
    Here additional tabs for modules can be created and modified.<br />
    <br />
    <b>User</b><br />
    To administer users of the system: their main info and settings.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Role</b><br />
    To edit roles; a role is a set of permissions for the Project-modules (non Global ones) that is assigned to
    users.<br />
    <br />
    <b>General</b><br />
    This is a general configurations tab.<br />
    Currently it has only one field: 'Company name'.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:6:"Module";s:7185:"<br />
    <b>Module tab</b><br />
    <br />
    The Module Designer is a very easy-to-use visual drag & drop interface to create modules or modify the existing
    ones.<br />
    <br />
    Firstly you press the <b>add</b> button or select an existing module from the grid. Then the form shows
    the label and permits you to choose whether it is currently active or not (whether it is shown in the system).
    <br />
    Pressing the <b>Open Dialog</b> button a pop-up window appears with the designer itself.<br />
    <br />
    <b>The Module Designer interface</b><br />
    <br />
    It has 3 panels:<br />
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>The left fields panel:</b> here are all the field types; <i>text</i>, <i>date</i>, <i>time</i>,
            <i>datetime</i>, <i>select</i>, <i>checkbox</i>, <i>percentage</i>, <i>rating</i>, <i>textarea</i> and
            <i>upload</i>.<br />
            You can drag & drop fields to the right panel, that right panel is the tab of the module you are creating
            or modifying as it will be seen (but without buttons <b>Edit</b> and <b>Delete</b>).<br />
            The <b>Edit</b> button in the right side of the fields, permits modifying its data before adding them to
            the module tab (right panel) although it is also possible to drag and drop it first and then edit it
            pressing that button in the right panel.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The right tabs panel:</b> this has the main tabs of the module as they are going to be seen when you
            open it outside the <b>Module Designer</b> (except for the Edit / Delete buttons). You add fields dragging
            and dropping them from the left panel, then pressing <b>Edit</b> button the edit panel is opened in the
            left bottom part of the window so that you can configure the field.<br />
            The fields can be reordered with drag & drop method and deleted from the tab dragging & dropping them back
            to the left panel or just pressing <b>Delete</b> button.<br />
            There are as many tabs in this panel as tabs are defined in module <b>Administration</b> submodule
            <b>Tab</b>.<br />
            You don't need to use all the tabs created. The tab will appear in the module only if there are fields
            inside it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The left bottom editing panel:</b> here, when it is pressed the <b>Edit</b> button of a field, a
            window appears to modify its values and parameters.<br />
            It has 4 tabs:<br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Databse:</b> to edit the data of the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Form:</b> to edit the data shown in the form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Grid:</b> to edit whether the field is shown in the grid or not, and its position inside it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>General:</b> general parameters.

    <b>How to create a module, from zero</b><br />
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>
            Assuming you are in the <b>Module</b> tab of <b>Administration</b> module, press <b>Add</b> button.
        </li>
        <li>
            An empty form appears. Write the name of the new module in the <b>Label</b> textbox.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press the <b>Open Dialog</b> button. A big pop-up window containing the module designer appears.<br />
            You will see the two big panels, one at the left and one at the right, and an empty space in the left
            bottom where the field editing window eventually appears.<br />
            Inside the right panel (the module as it will be seen outside the designer) there is a Project select box.
            That field should exist for the module to work, it is the relation between the item and the projects, don't
            delete it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add to the right panel using drag & drop a field of your choice. If there is more than one tab in the right
            panel, you can select the tab you want previous to the drag & drop to set the field there. In both cases,
            after dropping it the editing window appears for you to configure the field.<br />
            Note: to drop the field, you have to position it with the mouse over a place where the floating box that
            you are dragging converts itself from reddish pink to green color; that color means that you are able to
            drop the field there, up or behind another field.
        </li>
        <li>
            Configure the field attending to each of the 4 tabs of the editing window as explained here above.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the steps 5 and 6 as many times as fields you want to add.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the fields in the right panel in the order you want using drag & drop.
        </li>
        <li>
            Press the <b>Close</b> button in the left bottom of the window.
        </li>
        <li>
            The pop-up window has been closed. Press <b>Save</b> and the module is finished. The saving act, for
            example when <i>creating</i> a module, creates the table in the database, saves the parameters and creates
            the structure of folders and files.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <b>Notes:</b><br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            After saving a new module, it is needed to refresh the page in the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            The module will be added the <b>Access</b>, <b>Notification</b> and <b>History</b> tabs.
        </li>
        <li>
            There could be dragged back right panel fields to the left panel. This is useful to take them back later
            to the right panel, or to move them to another right panel tab.

            <u>It is not recommended to modify the original modules that come with the system. Most of them have

    <b>TAB tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This section permits modifying the tabs of the modules.<br />
    <br />
    Its purpose is just to manage how many user defined tabs could exist in the modules, and their names. For example,
    if there are 3 tabs: the default 'Basic Data' one plus two created by you, in the 'Module Designer' you can define
    which tabs to use in a specific module; you don't need to use all the tabs created. The tab will appear in the
    module only if when modifying it with the <b>Module Designer</b> you drop fields inside it.<br />
    E.g.: you can create an extra tab 'Geographic Info' and create a module with the <b>Module designer</b>.
    If you just drag & drop fields to the 'Basic Data' tab and nothing to the 'Geographic Info' tab, then the second
    tab won't be seen in the module.<br />

    <b>Role tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This tab permits managing the Roles.<br />
    <br />
    A Role is a specific set of permissions for each module. That Role then is assigned to users of the Projects you
    want, so that he will have that rights. When you create or edit a Project, you can give every different user that
    Role inside Rol tab.<br />
    The final right for a specific user to work with an item is defined by the conjunction of the data defined both
    inside Role and Access tabs of Project module.<br />
    <br />
    By default, no Role is assigned to anybody, and the permission to access to a new project will be <b>Admin</b>
    access  for the creator and nothing for the rest.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Example</b>
    <br />
    You can create a Role called 'Can read TODOs and NOTEs'.<br />
    And set in that Role <i>Read</i> access to the <b>Todo</b> and <b>Note</b> modules.<br />
    Then you create a Project and assign the user 'john' the Role 'Can read TODOs and NOTEs', so when he enters the
    Project, the only thing he will be able to do apart from reading the main data of the Project itself is to read
    (but not modify) items of <b>Todo</b> and <b>Note</b> modules.<br />

    This is the <b>General Help of Gantt module</b><br />
    <br />
    This module is a Gantt chart interface, mouse editable, which is automatically synchronized with the data stored in
    the database.<br />
    <br />
    A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. Gantt charts illustrate the start and
    finish dates of the terminal (children) elements and summary (parent) elements of a Project.<br />
    The module reads the Projects and Subprojects and elaborates a graphic that has one horizontal bar per Project
    (timeline) which can be moved with the mouse scrolling it over time or just increasing or decreasing the start and
    end dates.<br />
    <br />
    Up the chart there is a space where a panel called 'Selected Project Timeline' appears. When you click on a Project
    timeline bar, this panel's fields get loaded with the start and end dates of clicked bar Project, so that you can
    see and/or modify them writing different dates or selecting them in the calendar that pops up for each field.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:15:"Listed Projects";s:1610:"<br />
    The listed Projects are those you have at least Read access to, and also that they have filled 'Start Date' and
    'End Date' values.<br />
    <br />
    Firstly there will be listed all Projects that are children of the active one, no matter whether it is Root Project
    (PHProjekt) or another one.<br />
    If one of the listed Projects has at least one child, it will be shown a [+] plus sign at its left for you to click
    it or the Project name and open it and see its children under it. The children may also have Sub-Projects, and so
    on.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Timeline</b><br />
    <br />
    According to the earlier Start Date and latest End Date for all the Projects, a specific amount of years will fill
    the horizontal scope of the timeline.<br />
    The timeline always starts in January and ends in December but those months not necessary correspond to the same
    year.<br />
    For all years that have at least one month occupied by a Project bar, 12 months will be shown.<br />
    E.g.: If 2 Projects are listed, one starting in Jul-08 and ending in Aug-08, and the other starting in Dec-08 and
    ending in Mar-09 then 24 months will be shown in the timeline, from Jan-08 to Dic-09.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Bars</b><br />
    <br />
    The bar of each Project occupies a proportional horizontal surface and position according its dates, so that you can
    visually perceive its duration in time, relation and proportion paying attention to the column headers, and compare
    it with its Sub-Projects, parent or another Projects.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:14:"Changing dates";s:2052:"<br />
    <b>MOVING AND RESIZING THE BARS</b><br />
    <br />
    There are two ways of modifying times of a Project through the mouse and the bars: Moving and Resizing them.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Moving the Bars</b><br />
    <br />
    Click on the body of any of them (not the darker left and right borders) and without releasing the mouse button,
    drag them left or right to the new position.<br />
    You won't be able to drag it to a point outside the timeline, like a previous or posterior year.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Resizing the Bars</b><br />
    <br />
    You can click on a bar border and without releasing the mouse drag it left or back to increase or decrease Project
    length.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Selected Project Timeline panel</b><br />
    <br />
    When you click on the bar, like in the previous cases, a panel 'Selected Project Timeline' appears showing you the
    exact Start and End dates for the Project.<br />
    Also, after you drag or resize a bar using the mouse, those dates will be shown and get updated automatically
    according to the new position of the bar.<br />
    See 'Changing dates using the panels' part of this help for more details of the panel use.<br />
    <br />
    <hr style='height: 2px;'>
    <b>USING THE PANELS</b><br />
    <br />
    You can see the exact Start and End dates for any bar of the Projects.<br />
    <br />
    Just click on one bar, and a panel called 'Selected Project Timeline' will appear on top of the window Gantt
    section showing you both dates. After changing any bar width and/or position, both fields get updated automatically
    with the changes made to the bar.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Modifying the Dates using those fields</b><br />
    <br />
    Those 2 dates are editable; you can click on any of them and pick a date in the dynamic pop-up calendar that
    appears behind, or write it manually in the field.<br />
    Then press the Check button; if no error is found the bar will move onto its new parameters.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:17:"Checks and errors";s:2883:"<br />
    After you change Project dates either from the bar (moving the whole bar or just a border of it) or upper panel
    fields, internal checks are performed. If any error is found, one of the following four errors will be brought up
    in a dialog for you to choose what to do. XX in the error title means a Project name.<br />
    <br />
    Note: all errors are connected with the fact that in this structure of Projects hierarchy all Sub-Projects are
    supposed to happen inside parent's time.<br />
    <br />
    Errors:<br />
    <br />
    <b>Subproject XX starts before parent project XX</b><br />
    <br />
    When you change a Start date of a Project so that any of its children now starts before it, this error appears.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Error pop-up dialog offers you to choose one of these three options:<br />
    Click OK for the Sub-Project Start date to be moved forward to match parent's Start date.<br />
    Click Reset to restore the moved Project to its previous position and/or width.<br />
    Click the top right [x] cross button or Esc to leave things as they are.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Subproject XX ends after parent project XX</b><br />

    When you change an End date of a Project so that now it ends before any of its children, this error appears.<br />
    <br />
    The Error pop-up dialog offers you to choose one of these three options:<br />
    Click OK for the Sub-Project End date to be moved backwards to match parent's End date.<br />
    Click Reset to restore the moved Project to its previous position and/or width.<br />
    Click the top right [x] cross button or Esc to leave things as they are.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Parent project XX starts after subproject XX</b><br />
    <br />
    When you change a Start date of a Sub-Project so that now it starts before its parent, this error appears.<br />
    <br />
    The Error pop-up dialog offers you to choose one of these three options:<br />
    Click OK for the parent Project Start date to be moved backwards to match child's Start date.<br />
    Click Reset to restore the moved Sub-Project to its previous position and/or width.<br />
    Click the top right [x] cross button or Esc to leave things as they are.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Parent project XX ends before subproject XX</b><br />

    <br />
    Items tab is a submodule inside a tab.<br />
    It has a Grid at its left and a Form at its right, this right Form is used to fill the left Grid, just like a
    common module.<br />
    <br />
    The Items Grid is intended to show the contents of the meeting ordered and divided by Topics. Each Topic may have
    Statements, Todos, Decisions and Dates, and according to each of these 5 kind of content for the Grid, different
    columns of it will be filled.<br />
    <br />
    New Items Grid elements are added to the Items Grid from an empty Form or pressing New in the Form, then filling it
    and pressing Save. To edit or delete existing Items Grid elements click on them and the content will be filled into
    the Items Form at the right.<br />

    The purpose is that, when meeting contents are 100% filled in this Tab Grid, it shows all the contents of the
    meeting ordered, maybe chronologically, and showing behind each Topic row its statements, todos, decisions and
    dates so that the Grid is a clear representation of all main events and ideas discussed during the meeting.<br />

    E.g.: if you add a Topic as the first item for Items Grid, it will show number 1 in this column. If you add another
    one behind it, it will show number 2.<br />
    The rest of types of items added here will be under a Topic and will have the Topic's number plus a point and a
    'inside-Topic' element number. So that if you add a 'Statement' row behind Topic 1, it will show here '1.1'.
    If there is no any Topic over it, it will show '0.1'.<br />
    This column shows a value on all types of rows.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Title</b><br />

    This is the <b>General Help of Project module</b><br />

    The Projects are the most important functional part of the system. The user creates a Project to work with, and then
    loads all the data on the Project itself plus the associated modules that were activated for it (view Module tab
    inside a project). As time goes by, data can be added or modified.<br />
    <br />
    The owner and users with appropriate permissions can give specific rights to the users they want on a specific
    Project, like roles or just individual rights for them to access it, see its content and maybe modify it.<br />
    <br />
    The Project module has another modules associated that are part of it. Those associations are defined in Module tab,
    which can be seen when editing the Project itself. The modules that come with the original release of the
    system and can be associated will be called in this help as <b>General modules</b> and they are Project, Gantt,
    Statistic, Todo, Note, Filemanager, Minute and Helpdesk.<br />
    <br />
    Those general modules can be accessed from:<br />

            <b>The root Project:</b> you click on the logo and the Project module opens, with all the main Projects
            listed in the grid. Those are the Projects associated to the root of the system. You will see all the

    <b>Gantt</b><br />
    This module is a Gantt chart interface, mouse editable, which is automatically synchronized to the Project data
    loaded in the database.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Statistic</b><br />
    This module sums all the worked hours, classifies them by Projects and Sub-Projects and shows them in a chart table.
    <br />
    <br />
    <b>Todo</b><br />
    The Todo is a module to store To-Do items and assign them to a user.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Note</b><br />
    The Note is just a module to leave notes and associate them to a Project or Subproject.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Filemanager</b><br />
    The File manager is a module defined exclusively for uploading and downloading files from the system.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Minute</b><br />
    This module is meant for the transcription of meeting minutes.<br />
    <br />
    <b>Helpdesk</b><br />
    The Helpdesk is a module to report and track bugs or issues that must be solved inside whatever context.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Note: all these modules are explained in detail inside its appropriate section of the help.<br />
    <br />
    <br />";s:4:"Role";s:1569:"<br />
    <b>Role tab</b><br />
    <br />
    This tab permits assigning roles to the users.<br />
    A Role is a specific set of permissions defined for each module. They are set in <b>Administration -&#62; Role</b>.
    For example a role could be 'Admin in all modules' or 'Admin in Filemanager, read only in the rest'.<br />
    The final right for a specific user to work with an item is defined by the conjunction of what is defined both
    inside Role and Access tabs.<br />
    <br />
    By default, no Role is assigned to anybody, and the right to a new project will be <b>Admin</b> access for the
    creator and nothing for the rest. This changes when permissions are assigned in the <b>Access</b> and <b>Role</b>
    tabs.<br />
    <br />
    For example, a specific Role can give Admin access to Todo module and just Read access for Helpdesk module. It means
    that if a user has that Role assigned for a Project, then he/she will be able to do everything with the Todo items
    that have that Project as parent but will just be able to see, and not modify Helpdesk items that also have that
    Project as parent.<br />
    <br />
    Notes:<br />
    <ul>
        <li>
            Each Role scope is defined by Admin users in Administration module.
        </li>
        <li>
            Important: when a Project doesn't have any Roles defined, then it inherits its parent Roles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roles don't affect top right linked Global modules like Calendar, Contact, etc.
        </li>
